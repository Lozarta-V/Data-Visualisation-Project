# Wealth of Nations Data Analysis 

## Project Overview

As part of a Data Visualisation Project, I used Excel and Tableau to visualise the Wealth of Nations dataset. In this project, I cleaned, filtered, and sorted the Wealth of Nations data in Excel and created charts. I also password protected the Excel file to ensure data security. The project requirement was to create a dashboard suitable for a colour-blinded client, so I used a single gradient of blue in my dashboard, utilising symbols and labels.

## Steps and Tools Used

### Excel:
- **Data Cleaning** üßπ: Removed inconsistencies and errors from the dataset.
- **Filtering and Sorting** : Organised the data for better analysis.
- **Chart Creation** : Developed initial visualisations to understand data trends.
- **Password Protection** üîê: Secured the Excel file to maintain data integrity.

### Tableau:
- **Data Import** : Loaded the cleaned Wealth of Nations dataset into Tableau.
- **Setting Relationships** üîó: Defined relationships between tables to ensure accurate data representation.
- **Dashboard Creation** : Designed an interactive dashboard featuring various types of charts to provide comprehensive insights.

## Dashboard Visualisations

The Tableau dashboard includes the following five visuals:

1. **Global Smartphone Users 2020** 
2. **Europe Smartphone Users 2020** 
3. **Global GDP per Capita 2019** 
4. **Global Life Expectancy 2020** 
5. **Europe GDP per Capita 2019** 
   
## Repository Contents

- **Excel Files** :
  - Cleaned and processed data.
  - Password-protected to ensure data security.
- **Tableau Workbook** :
  - Includes all visualisations and the comprehensive dashboard.
- **Word File**:
  - Data Visualisation Project document including screenshots from Excel and Tableau. 

## Conclusion

This project showcases the effective use of Excel for data cleaning and protection, followed by advanced data visualisation and interactive dashboard creation in Tableau. By transforming raw data into meaningful insights through accessible visualisations, this analysis provides valuable information on global and regional economic indicators, life expectancy, and smartphone usage patterns. The dashboard design also ensures accessibility for colour-blind users through the use of a single gradient of blue, symbols, and labels.
